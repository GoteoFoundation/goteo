    Hi %USERNAME%,


    We want to remind you that it is essential that you upload the necessary documents so that we can transfer the raised funds.


    The contract is already available so that you can fill it with the required data: %PROJECTCONTRACTURL%


    We only need the digital version of the documents, since you will be able to upload them to the platform. The requested docs are:


    **Physical persons:**



      *   **Digital copy of the DNI/NIE** of the person signing the contract (if Spanish resident) or passport (non-Spanish resident) (PDF)
      *   **Certificate of ownership of the bank account** (PDF), issued by the financial institution in which the funds collected will be received. In case your bank is outside of Spain, you must also have the IBAN code (if it is an European International bank) and a SWIFT code if it is a non-European Bank.


    **Legal persons/entities:**



      *   **Digital copy of the DNI/NIE** of the person signing the contract (if Spanish resident) or passport (non-Spanish resident) (PDF)
      *   **Certificate of ownership of the bank account** (PDF), issued by the financial institution in which the funds collected will be received. In case your bank is outside of Spain, you must also have the IBAN code (if it is an European International bank) and a SWIFT code if it is a non-European Bank.
      *   **Digital copy of the CIF of the entity** (PDF). In case it is not registered in Spain, a digital copy of the organization's registration in the corresponding official entity. 
      *   **Digital copy of the document certifying the power of attorney** (legal status, or deed, or power of attorney which accredit the representative person who signs) (PDF).
