Goteo The Open Source Crowdfunding Platform
===========================================

This is the source code of the [Crowdfunding platform Goteo](http://goteo.org)

**THIS IS IN BETA STATUS**, Bugs can be expected and it's still a lot of work to do.

Although you can try to install it in order to create your own crowdfunding platform, this won't be a *Wordpress*-like installation (probably never will). This release is mostly for developers and for those who want to collaborate with the code.

Full developers documentation is still work in progress!
Some folders may have its own README.md file with comments. However, we will try to compile all the documents here:

### DOCUMENTATION

- [Install](http://goteofoundation.github.io/goteo/install.html)
- [Upgrade](http://goteofoundation.github.io/goteo/upgrade.html)

### CONTRIBUTING

Please, be aware that all this system is under development and in a middle-step migration status.

There's still a lot of documentation missing. We'll try to do our best on complete it, however any help will be appreciated.
